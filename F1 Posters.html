          <h3>Max Verstappen</h3>
          <p>This poster is of four-time world champion max Verstappen, made in 2023 when I was learning Photoshop and procreate. This poster was a struggle and took approximatly two weeks to make as I wasn't too familiar with the applications. Procreate had an easier learning curve as it is similar to traditional art to some extent but offers a much more customizable amount of colors and brushes to use within a singular application. I used the default brushes already provided in the app. I used two or three different brushes which are Spectra, Tamar, and Syrup.



I started off with a sketch drawing out max in a side view. Then i started sketching the f1 car based on his recoveries in the track by drifting. Then i sketched out the track in a different layer.

I knew i wanted this poster to pop so i used a vibrant colors throught the poster specially since
those are the actual colors for both the track and the red bull team. I added some other small details like the helmet of max.

Lastly, I used photoshop for all the typography. For the f1 logo tho i used the offical logo for f1 and placed it at the cornerl

          <h3>Liam Lawson</h3>
          <p>This poster is of Liam Lawson, currently a red bull driver after replacing Sergio Perez. This is a poster to hype up the new driver. It took me appoximaly 1 week to do this poster.



This poster was made using illustrator. Unlike the Max Verstappen one, this one didnt have a sketch i could already use so i had to make one in the application. With this poster i wanted to capture Liam as the new driver so i had him at the center with a full side profile of the red bull car. Similar to the other poster is has vibrant colors with the RB Labels and sponsors.

I also added a plane in the back which was originally suppose to have liam lawsons name in a banner. However i decided o go wih this approch to simplify it</p>

          <h3>Max Poster part 2</h3>
          <p>This poster is of four-time world champion max Verstappen, made in 2025.
The poster was made in illustrator, it is similar to the original but is simplified a bit with sun ray background.



This was an attempt to make use of illustrator more. The process is similar to illustrator but the tools were different in many ways,

I used the sketches i had on the original and used it to make this one similar to it.
the colors are more darker than the original and there isnt as many details. The background is also changed, there is a sun ray type of pattern. I also changed the one and the positioning of many of the labels.</p>
